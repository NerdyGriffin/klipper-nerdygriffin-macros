# LED Group Variable Definitions
# Part of klipper-nerdygriffin-macros
#
# Purpose:
# - Provide a hardware-agnostic mapping from logical LED groups
#   (nozzle, bed/logo, chamber left/right) to actual LED device names
# - Optionally expose pixel indices for devices that contain multiple LEDs
#
# Usage:
# - Override any of the variables below in your local printer.cfg after including this file:
#   [gcode_macro _LED_VARS]
#   variable_nozzle_led: "toolhead"
#   variable_bed_led: "bed_light"
#   variable_chamber_led_right: "panel_right"
#   variable_chamber_led_left: "panel_left"
#   variable_nozzle_led_indices: "0,1"  # optional indices within the device
#
# - In other macros, access via: {% set L = printer['gcode_macro _LED_VARS'] %}
#   Then reference L.nozzle_led, L.bed_led, etc. Check they exist in printer before SET_LED.
#
# Notes:
# - Leave variables as empty strings to indicate the group is not present.
# - Indices are optional and comma-separated if used; consumers should split safely.
#
